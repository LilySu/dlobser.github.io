  	<p>The electric grid, the telephone network, the underground pipes and avenues of transportation are the veins and neurons of a larger organism.  If you look at satellite imagery of human cities what you will see is a growing cancer.  We are ravenous, we must grow and expand and multiply, this is our biological imperative.  We are large, our brains are large, we are intelligent and we need to consume large amounts of various kinds of foods every single day.  Our will and our instinct was born in a period of extreme abundance and extreme danger.  There is safety in numbers and so we made more of us as if the act of replication was a service to god.     </p>

<p>We think we make decisions.  We think we think.  These decisions and thoughts are the product of our bodies: meat expressions of code that can be stored in a wrapper that is much smaller than what we can see.  We're fractals.  Excuse me if you've heard this one before, it's hardly an original thought.  We will all die, there are powerful forces that drive us to consume, to reproduce, to grow and to dominate.  Murder is embedded in us, we are a horribly violent species, and in this we are hardly alone.  We're perhaps more like sea otters who will rape and murder and kidnap or chimpanzees who commit infanticide and start wars.  </p>

<p>Normalcy is an illusion that requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of nature.  The universe would be too overwhelming all the time for us to even function if we weren't able to see everything as normal, to accept things, for situations to become boring.  Try to imagine the amount of work that is required for us to experience boredom.  It is monumental.  So many trillions of cells, our blood, or heart beat, the organs that filter and churn, the agreements we've made, and still we can be bored.  How remarkable.</p>

<p>And so we want things.  We 'decide' that we're going to live our lives in a certain way.  If we were to spend all of our time interrogating all of our drives and our tastes then surely there would be no time to actually LIVE.  So to live we go where the spirit takes us.  You could say we're all ideas, expressions of a thought, an attempt to apply that thought to an actual situation.  It is impossible to say right at the beginning if an idea will be good or bad or useful or not.  Some seemingly good ideas can be easily perverted, one need only look to the results of the ideologies of the 20th century.  Capitalism will merely be the last to find itself dashed upon the rocks, leaving future generations a legacy of plastic.  The earth needed plastic so it made us, and now that it has enough it's ready to scrape us off like troublesome barnacles.</p>

<p>In the same way, the ideas we have, the things we think are normal and acceptable can be perverted and manipulated and we can get used to these perversions easily and if everyone else thinks they're normal then it's only natural that we will too.  It is far too difficult and painful a thing to actually try to change anything.  It is far too difficult until the alternatives seem worse.  And so we go along, we take on the habits of those around us, we try to make ourselves a little exceptional in some way that is acceptable, these are called norms and they're quite normal, we're social creatures and it's all so inside us and so obvious that it mostly doesn't even need to be thought about.</p>

<p>These are images of the houses that swarms built.  You can see how remarkably efficient and organized they are.  There is no evidence to suggest that the creatures that built these structures had an image of the structures in their mind.  Rather it seems more likely that they followed simple behavioral rules with the structures being a result but not anything resembling an intentional goal.  This idea is born out in simulations of autonomous agenst.  Cellular automata and flocks are two standard approaches to modeling complex interactions between simple elements.  The cell and the boid know nothing of the larger patterns they generate, they are just following a simple and specific set of rules.  This concept can be expanded to include interactions across the natural world.  We can see it in the cells that make our bodies and the cities that our bodies make.  We can also see it in our thoughts.  An idea, an action, a motivation is like the average direction of a swarm of individual thoughts.  These thoughts are mostly unconscious, we take in vastly more information than we are capable of being conscious of.  So consciousness is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
